In no way shape or form is this meant to hurt nintendo. Just a cool project to explore low level systems and os design. Through something I love

The program has a virtual cpu and bus. Please take the time to look through the code.

Use make to play a game with it. You need to have a nes game to play on it

Please only download nes games that you have a physical copy of and have bought.
